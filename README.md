# Image Denoising
The main challenge in digital image processing is to remove noise from the original image. We demonstrate two commonly used algorithms in image denoising:
<ul>
  <li>Non-local means algorithms</li>
  <li>Total variation minimization</li>
  </ul>
For non-local means algorithm, we calculate the weights so as to understand how algorithm works. Additionally, we consider the case of variable illumination and show how Nl-means is susceptible to such cases. We also discuss one possible way to deal with images with variable illumination.

## Future Work
<ul>
  <li>Show that using fourier filtering actually improves Nl-means</li>
  <li>Support for RGB images</li>
  </ul>
